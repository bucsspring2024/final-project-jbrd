"Leaf | Definition, Parts, & Function | Britannica",https://www.britannica.com/science/leaf-plant-anatomy,"Learn about the definition, parts, and types of leaves, the green outgrowths from the stem of vascular plants that produce food by photosynthesis. Explore the diversity and adaptations of leaves in different plants, from simple to complex, and their roles in ecology and evolution."
Leaf - Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf,"A leaf (pl.: leaves) is a principal appendage of the stem of a vascular plant, usually borne laterally aboveground and specialized for photosynthesis.Leaves are collectively called foliage, as in ""autumn foliage"", while the leaves, stem, flower, and fruit collectively form the shoot system. In most leaves, the primary photosynthetic tissue is the palisade mesophyll and is located on the upper ..."

Leaves are made up of cells that usually contain a high concentration of chloroplasts (cell organelles unique to plants) and are specialized sites for photosynthesis. We will explore photosynthesis in greater detail later; for now, remember that photosynthesis is the ..."
